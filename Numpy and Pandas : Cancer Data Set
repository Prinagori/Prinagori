1.	For the cancer data set, compute the correlation coefficient between Diameter and Pigment.  Use Pandas and the .corr() method.  

2.	For a column of data x and a column of data y, there is an equation that relates the slope of the line of best fit (m) with the correlation coefficient (r).  That equation is:
    m = r * std(y)/std(x)
          In the equation above, std(y) represents the standard deviation of the y column of data and std(x) is the standard deviation of the x column of data.
          Use the Pandas .corr() and .std() methods to compute the slope of the line of best fit between Diameter and Pigment.
          Next, use compute the y-intecept of the line of best fit using:
              b = ybar – m*xbar
	        Lastly, plot the line of best fit using matplotlib.pyplot.
          
3.	Again, use the cancer data set.  Use Pandas and/or NumpPy functions to help you solve.  What is the average diameter among cancerous observations?  
    What is the average diameter among non-cancerous observations?

4.	Expanding on question 2.  When we have observed data from two different groups, we may want to assess whether the two groups have a difference in means which is statistically significant.  
    One common test to test statistical significance about any difference in means is the 2-Sample T-Test.

        Then try these commands:
            •	from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
            •	ttest_ind(cancerousDF['Diameter'],noncancerousDF['Diameter'])

5.	Find the 5 nearest neighbors for a stock that has 4.5% growth, $4 billion in market cap, and a risk factor of 0.5.  Use the stockGrowth.csv data set.  Remember to scale the data accordingly.
